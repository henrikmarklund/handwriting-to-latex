    "### 1. Background\n",
    "We were typing up our CS229 homework and realized that we were spending more time on LaTeX than the actual homework. We did a quick informal survey amongst students in the Huang basement who concurred: yes, typesetting is a major inconvenience! Many said they spent over 5 and 10 hours per homework in CS221 and CS229 respectively. Another typical response was: “I chose not to typeset on the last CS229 homework, as I did not have time”.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There is currently no good solution for converting handwritten notes into LateX. As a consequence, STEM students around the world struggle. The long term goal is to train an algorithm that takes a scan of your a4 page and turns it into latex typesetting. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We limit the scope of this project to:\n",
    "1. Create a seq-to-seq model with attention turning images of digital equations into latex. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also a request-for-research at OpenAI: https://openai.com/requests-for-research/#im2latex \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Dataset\n",
    "Harvard Researchers have crawled wikipedia for mathematical equations and gathered a 100k equations from which one can generate images. Dataset: Harvard im-to-latex-100k (Described in __[Deng et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04938.pdf)__) Guilluame Genthial at Stanford was kind enough to send us his generated images (as this takes quite some time). We do some additional processing (padding, and additional downsampling).\n",

    "### 3. Progress through the projeect (sequential):\n",
    "\n",
    "__1. Dataset loaded and processed.__ <br>\n",
    "We have approx 80k images with corresponding latex loaded and preprocessed. For now we skip looking at too long sentences and too big images.<br><br>\n",
    "__2. Encoder-Decoder model up and running.__ <br>\n",
    "Our model is based on a typical seq-to-seq model for translation. We started out with a seq-to-seq model for translation in Keras using LSTM (__[Described by Francois Chollet](https://blog.keras.io/a-ten-minute-introduction-to-sequence-to-sequence-learning-in-keras.html)__. We replaced the encoder with a convolution neural network as described by in the paper __[Image to Latex by Genthial & Sauvestre (2016)](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/815.pdf)__. The conv. network design is one of the versions __[here](https://github.com/guillaumegenthial/im2latex/blob/master/model/encoder.py)__. We have one model for training and one model for inference (using the weights from the first model). Pictures of the models are below.<br><br>\n",
    "__3. Overfit to 10 examples__<br>\n",
    "After introducing Batch Normalization we managed to overfit to 10 examples. Still hard to overfit to many more examples. Could be that we need to train for a lot longer. When we do inference it seems to have learned a few different equations that it chooses among. As you'll see when you do inference with pretrained weights on the 40k images, it seems to choose from a set of equations that it predicts over and over.<br><br>\n",
    "__4. Training with decreasing loss on 40k images / sequences__ <br>\n",
    "Training is really slow which makes it important that we are systematic and smart about our experiments going forward.\n",
    "Implemented Clip Gradient and a Learning rate schedule.<br><br>\n",
    "__5. For debugging: Created an analogous but less complex problem.__ <br>\n",
    "Since it was hard to know why it was so hard overfitting to a larger number of examples we created a simpler but analogous problem: turning pictures of text into text (but treating each character as a separate token to keep the problem analogous). Training was a lot easier, and we could much more easily overfit on a larger number training examples.\n",
    "__6. Switched to TensorFlow and the Seq2seq library.__ <br>\n",
    "__7. Got the Keras model to work without attention.__ <br>\n",
    "__8. Got the Tensorflow model with attention to work improving accuracy by a lot.__ <br>\n",
